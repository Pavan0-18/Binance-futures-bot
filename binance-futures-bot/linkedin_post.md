# LinkedIn Post: Binance Futures Trading Bot

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: A Comprehensive Binance Futures Trading Bot!**

I've developed a robust CLI-based trading bot for Binance USDT-M Futures that supports multiple advanced order types and trading strategies. Here's what makes it special:

## 🔥 Key Features:
• **Multiple Order Types**: Market, Limit, Stop-Limit, OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other)
• **Advanced Strategies**: TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) and Grid Trading
• **Risk Management**: Position sizing calculations and validation
• **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed trade tracking and error handling
• **Safety First**: Mock client for testing, input validation, and error handling

## 🛠️ Technical Stack:
• **Python** with `python-binance` API integration
• **CLI Interface** using `argparse` for easy command-line usage
• **Environment-based configuration** for secure API key management
• **Modular architecture** with separate modules for each order type

## 📊 What I Learned:
• Deep dive into Binance Futures API and order management
• Implementation of complex trading strategies (TWAP, Grid)
• Best practices for financial API integration and error handling
• Building production-ready CLI tools with comprehensive documentation

## 🔒 Safety & Testing:
The bot includes a mock client for safe testing and validation, ensuring you can develop and test strategies without risking real funds.
